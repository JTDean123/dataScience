Visualizing and Clustering Seattle Crime Reports

Like all big cities, Seattle has areas and neighborhoods that feel safer or less safe than others. Personally, I know I have ideas about where I should be on my guard at night, neighborhoods where I should not park my car for extended periods of time, and areas that are not safe to buy a house in. Are these ideas I have correct? Do some neighborhoods and areas in Seattle really have more crime than others? Fortunately there is no need to speculate anymore - we have data! In particular, the Seattle Police Department uploads initial police reports to a publically accessible dataset 6-12 hours after responding to an incident. This data set includes information regarding location, time, and a summary of the offense description.
In this study we will study whether different neighborhoods in Seattle have different levels of crime.
