College Scorecard Data Analysis and Gradient Boost Regression Model of Predictive Earnings

Whether or not to attend college is a question that millions of high school seniors face every year.  Those choosing to attend further have to decide between two and four year schools, courses of study, and how to deal with the financial aspect of paying for years of training. The government contributed over 100 billion dollars (1) in appropriations and grants to finance higher education, including financial aid packages.  Despite this, it seems that many students are leaving school with considerable amounts of student debt.  Because of the massive financial impact that secondary education has on the economy the government created a College Scoreboard 'to provide reliable and unbiased information about college performance' (1).  In the making of this College Scoreboard data was compiled from the last 20 years pertaining to student financial returns on their college investment.  This quite large data set (2) contains key metrics like admissions rates, post graduation earnings of graduates, and the demographics of the students attending a school. 

In this analysis we evaluate the financial implications of attending a post secondary school.  Specifically, we analyze the cost and the earnings ten years after leaving a post secondary school to try to determine what factors most influence earnings after attending a post secondary institution.  Finally, we developed a gradient boosted regression supervised machine learning model to predict future earnings based on an institution's features.
