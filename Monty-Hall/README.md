Monty Hall Simulations

The 'Monty Hall' problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is a probability question based on a game played on the (once) popular Monty Hall game show.  The question is formulated as:  

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?  

It turns out if you want a goat, the answer is no.  However if you want a car the answer is yes.  This problem is solved analytically via Baye's formula, however here we 'solve' the problem using the occasionally more convincing simulations.
