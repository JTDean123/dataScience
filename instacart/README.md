DS450_final_project

I recently completed DS450, Deriving Knowledge from Data as Scale, from at the University of Washington. Our final project was based on a recent Instacart Kaggle competition, the goal being to predict the grocery basket items for returning customers based on their previous orders. This was an interesting project because it was a bit open ended and there were many way to approach it. My final model was a three layer feed forward neural network. The performance of this model was greatly inproved by implementing dropout and by using the adam optimizer. In fact, adam seems to outperform standard stochastic gradient descent optimizers in all of my projects. This project was really fun, and I only wish I had more time to dig deeper into the data and the model!
